# OECD Immigration Analysis

This is an analysis of OECD Immigration Data from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mexwell/international-migration-database/data). I loaded the dataset, set up an interactive dashboard using itables, and implemented a predictive model to predict immigration for a specific country and type of immigration.
